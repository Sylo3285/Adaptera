# Adaptera

A local-first LLM orchestration library with native support for Hugging Face, PEFT/LoRA, QLoRA, and API models — without hiding the model.

## Non-goals

This library does not aim to be a full ML framework or replace existing tools like LangChain. It focuses on providing a clean, minimal interface for local-first LLM orchestration.
